# RC-Model LED Light Distribution PCB

This small PCB allows you to distribute power for LED lightning in your RC-models. One PCB can handle multiple in- and outputs, through soldering jumpers you are also able to combine in- and outputs. Each output provides through-holes for LED series resistors, 2 outputs can be tied together for a single series resistor for 2 LEDs.  

## Usage
Usage should be fairly clear, you can connect the wires either through the provided through-holes or by using the soldering pads.  

## Production files
Subfolder `gerber` contains files required for production. These files have been prepared for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
